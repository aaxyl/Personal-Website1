								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My background and interest in IT dates to around 12 years back (around mid-2006), at which time I was given my first computer; a Pentium 4 powered PC. It was at this time when my fascination with IT was sparked, more specifically with computers; what components made up computers and how they work together to compute information. I started tinkering with various laptops and desktops the following years, however it was not until I finished secondary school when I had pieced together my workstation desktop using an old prebuilt computer from 2010, a decommissioned Xeon server CPU and an Nvidia graphics card.</p>
								<p>I came to RMIT to study Bachelor of IT, mostly because I've heard RMIT is one of the best schools to study engineering and technology related courses. If I were to be honest, it is also one of the schools that I had sufficient ATAR requirements to get a guaranteed entry into one of my desired courses, the other being network engineering & electrical and electronic engineering.</p>
								<p>During my time here at RMIT, I expect to learn more in-depth knowledge about computer systems as well as practical skills (such as programming/scripting) that'll help me with my goal in pursuing a career in system or network management, (i.e: system administration, network engineering).</p>

								<h3>Myers-Briggs test results:</h3>
								<h4><b><i>Advocate (Type A)</p>
								<p>Introverted: 56% | Extroverted: 44%</i></b></p>
								<p>Intuitive: 53% | Observant: 47%</p>
								<p>Feeling: 63% | Thinking: 37%</p>
								<p>Prospecting: 60% | Judging: 40%</p>
								<p>Assertive: 61% | Observant: 39%</p>
								<p> </p>
								<h3><b><i>Learning Style test results:</i></b></h3>
								<p>Auditory: 45%</p>

								<p>Visual: 35%</p>

								<p>Tactile: 20%</p>
								<p> </p>
								<h3><b><i>Big 5 Personality test results: (3rd test)</i></b></h3>
								<p>Openness: 65%</p>
								<p>Conscientiousness: 54%</p>
								<p>Extraversion: 46%</p>
								<p>Agreeableness: 65%</p>
								<p>Neuroticism: 35%</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>The results of the three tests above show that I am borderline INFJ and INFP (both being rare personality types), mostly an auditory learner, and have relatively high levels of openness and agreeableness, while having low levels of neuroticism.</p>
								<p>From what can be gathered in the results, my relatively higher intuitive, prospecting, feeling and assertive scores in the Myers-Briggs test indicate that I have the imagination and compassion to resolve technical and human issues, a suitable trait for a role such as a team advisor or counsellor. As well as being able to look through dishonest motives such as manipulation or lies. These scores also line up well with the results of the 3rd test; the Big 5 Personality test. However, the shortcomings as seen in the higher "feeling" and "introverted" score of the Myers-Briggs test also indicate that my behaviour and relationship with team members at the start would be more reserved. My sensitivity to others' criticism would also be higher than of average people, which can potentially result in a weaker relationship with my team and thus poor teamwork.</p>

								<p>Considering the positive and negative aspects of my personality type and how it'd influence my behaviour, a workplace or work environment that is based on prioritizing harmony and corporation would be beneficial to a personality type such as mine. Encouraging a harmonious, hardworking atmosphere while offering a helping hand to other team members would be more than idealistic for my behaviour to be in check in a team effort.</p>

								<p>Source: https://www.seek.com.au/job/35689341?type=promoted&userqueryid=d3a220a0aa70d262f5549942d73d1c8f-3465635</p>								
								<p></p>
								<p>Network engineering involves the implementation, maintenance, support, development and sometimes the design of communication networks within or between organisations. This job appeals to me most out of the other jobs for two reasons:</p>
								<p>It allows me to work with networking equipment out of reach of average tech consumers.</p>
								<p>It pays considerably well (range of $60,000 to $120,000+), seeing as one can acquire a position relatively easily with just CCNA (or higher) certification, which can already give me a job with a salary of around $75,000 without prior field experience.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>The skills needed for a job of this calibre would require a moderate level of analytical, leadership and organisational skills, as well as attention to detail and the ability to work well in a team. Almost all network engineers would also be expected to have qualifications such as a Bachelor in a computer-related course(i.e: computer science, engineering, programming, IT) and/or Cisco’s CCNA certification. With certain jobs possibly requiring additional certifications (e.g: Juniper, Wireshark, COMPTIA, etc).</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>Apart from general “people” and work skills (i.e: analytical, organisational, team player skills & attention to detail), I currently do not have the qualifications needed to acquire the position of network engineering. However I am planning to work myself up during my time in University to obtain my Bachelor, perhaps Masters qualification in Information Technology, and Cisco CCNA certification.</p>
