								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My background and interest in IT dates to around 12 years back (around mid-2006), at which time I was given my first computer; a Pentium 4 powered PC. It was at this time when my fascination with IT was sparked, more specifically with computers; what components made up computers and how they work together to compute information. I started tinkering with various laptops and desktops the following years, however it was not until I finished secondary school when I had pieced together my workstation desktop using an old prebuilt computer from 2010, a decommissioned Xeon server CPU and an Nvidia graphics card.</p>
								<p>I came to RMIT to study Bachelor of IT, mostly because I've heard RMIT is one of the best schools to study engineering and technology related courses. If I were to be honest, it is also one of the schools that I had sufficient ATAR requirements to get a guaranteed entry into one of my desired courses, the other being network engineering & electrical and electronic engineering.</p>
								<p>During my time here at RMIT, I expect to learn more in-depth knowledge about computer systems as well as practical skills (such as programming/scripting) that'll help me with my goal in pursuing a career in system or network management, (i.e: system administration, network engineering).</p>
